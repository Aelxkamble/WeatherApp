WeatherApp Using react and Api
Project Task: Develop a Responsive Weather App
Objective: To create a responsive weather application enabling users to search for a city and view current weather conditions. The app should offer Celsius/Fahrenheit unit conversion and include error handling. Additionally, implement a "recent searches" feature displaying the last five cities searched by the user.
Requirements:
1. User Interface:
Develop a responsive Ul suitable for desktop and mobile devices.
Include a search bar for users to input city names.
Display current temperature, weather conditions, and wind speed for the searched city.
Implement a toggle for users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
2. Weather Data:
Integrate with a public weather API like OpenWeatherMap to fetch current weather data.
Handle API errors gracefully and display appropriate error messages to users.
Validate user input to ensure it matches known city names.
3. Recent Searches:
Incorporate a "recent searches" feature displaying the last five cities searched by the user.
Each search entry should be clickable, allowing users to quickly revisit past searches.
4. Error Handling and Validation:
Implement robust error handling for API failures or invalid user input.
Validate user input to prevent unnecessary API calls for nonexistent city names.
Ensure a user-friendly experience with clear error messages.
